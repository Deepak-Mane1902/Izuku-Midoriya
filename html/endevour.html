                <b>Enji Todoroki </b>(轟とどろき炎えん司じ Todoroki Enji?), also known as the Flame Hero: <b> Endeavor</b> (フレイムヒーロー エンデヴァー Fureimu Hīrō Endevā?),
                 is the Pro Hero with the highest tally of resolved cases in history.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Appearance </h2>
            <p>Enji is a tall, sturdily-built man with a very muscular physique. He has short crimson hair which he wears spiked up around his head and sharp turquoise eyes. His beard and mustache appear to be made of fire, but when he voluntarily turns off the flames on his face, a small amount stubble shows around his jaw
                <br><br>
                His hero costume is comprised of a tight, navy turquoise bodysuit, with lines of flames streaming across his chest, upper torso, arms, and most prominently his shoulders. He uses his flames as a makeshift mask around his eyes, and the tall boots he wears appear to be either made of fire themselves or constantly left alight, as only their soles and laces are visible around the flames. He sports white bracers on his lower arms, styled in a cage pattern, and a blue belt with a pouch attached on either side.
                <br><br>
                During his battle against Hood, the left side of his face was greatly damaged after being hit by a surprise attack. After receiving surgery and being healed by Recovery Girl's Heal Quirk, his eye was shown to be alright, though he now has a large, jagged scar reaching from his hairline all the way down to his chin.
            <br><br>
            During the battle against All For One, he loses his right arm, being ripped off after being hit by one of the Rivet Stabs.
            </p>
             
                <h2>Powers and abilities</h2>  
                <img src="/img/end1.png" alt="">
                <p><span1>Overall Abilities : <span2>Hellflame</span2></span1> (ヘルフレイム Herufureimu?) Enji's Quirk allows him to produce and manipulate large amounts of extremely intense fire at will. Endeavor was ranked 2nd of Japan's heroes, before taking the spot of No. 1 after All Might's retirement. He is known for having the most solved cases out of any crime fighter, and by the age of 20, Endeavor took his place as the No. 2 Pro Hero. He also possesses a proficient handle on his powerful Quirk, Hellflame, using his flames to overwhelm his opponents with extreme heat, becoming airborne with flame propulsion, among other application.

                <li><span1>Enhanced Strength</span1>  After years of physical training, Endeavor obtained incredible physical strength, though it is not at the level of All Might. Impressively, he was able to knock the enormous Gigantomachia backwards with a flame-propelled skull bash.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>Enhanced Durability</span1> Endeavor possesses incredible durability as he was able to withstand being thrown through multiple concrete-laced skyscraper walls by Hood, who was using multiple Quirks, and emerge with moderate injuries.[18] When fighting a body-modified Tomura Shigaraki, Endeavor endured the impalement of the latter’s Rivet Stab Quirk and several of his augmented blows despite the villain possessing physical strength nearly rivaling that of All Might. Afterwards, Endeavor was able skull-bash the thick-bodied Gigantomachia without suffering significant head trauma, but the pyromancer was knocked unconscious by his own attack.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>Enhanced Stamina</span1>Endeavor is far more resistant to pain than the average Pro Hero, as seen when he was able to stand up, despite receiving numerous attacks from Hood, and long after his body should have become unable to move.[19] During the climax of the Paranormal Liberation War, Endeavor‘s movements were stymied by his Quirk overuse burning his lungs, and being repeatedly stabbed by Tomura's Rivet Stab Quirk. In spite of the said injuries, the pyrokinetic was still able to remain standing and eventually knock down Gigantomachia, but Endeavor himself was put out of commission afterwards.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>Enhanced Reflexes</span1> Due to training to become the No. 1 hero, Endeavor learned to react exceedingly fast to dangerous situations and people in need. During his battle with Hood he could counter one of his attacks with his "Jet Burn" in spite of his clouded vision. Later, while having a conversation outside with Izuku, Endeavor was able to react to a cry for help before the sound of the cry reached the One For All inheritor.

                    <h3>MY HERO ACADEMIA</h3><br>
                    <p>The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the 
                        human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called "Quirks" 
                        (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated 
                        that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk.</p>
