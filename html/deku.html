                <b>Izuku Midoriya</b> (緑みどり谷や出いず久く Midoriya Izuku?), also known as Deku (デク Deku?), 
                is the main protagonist of the My Hero Academia manga and anime series.
                Even though Izuku was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the 
                legendary hero All Might, due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice,
                 and has since become his close pupil, as well as a student in Class 1-A at U.A. 
                 High School. All Might passed on his transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the 
                 ninth and current holder of One For All.
                 Following the Paranormal Liberation War, with Tomura Shigaraki and All For One 
                 actively targeting Izuku for his Quirk, he decided to leave U.A. before finishing
                  his first year to keep his classmates out of harm's way.[4] After encouragement 
                  and support from his friends, he later returns to the school and leads the heroes
                   against the villains in one final, desperate battle to save the world.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Appearance </h2>
            <p>Izuku is somewhat short for his age, his round face is framed by a short mop of fluffy
                 dark-green hair which sticks up at odd angles around his head, casting noticeably 
                 dark shadows onto itself. His eyes are large and somewhat circular, their irises the
                  same shade of green as his hair, which at times are very watery, and are usually
                  stretched quite wide, giving him an innocent, energized appearance. He has a
                   set of four symmetrical freckles in diamond formations, one on each cheek.
                   Though he was initially very skinny, Izuku has gained toned muscles after his 
                   ten months of extensive training with All Might, and as the series progresses, 
                   these are shown to become more developed and defined as he gradually grows 
                   stronger. <br>
                During his time in Junior High School, he wore a plain black gakuran uniform with 
                yellow buttons, accompanied by white sneakers. While at home, he wears a green 
                jinbei over a white shirt and gray sweatpants. <br>
                
                Izuku's first hero costume, known as "Costume Alpha," was a green full-body 
                jumpsuit with a red belt, elbow pads, knee pads, and gloves, along with his 
                signature red boots. He also wears a mask with long ear-like protrusions that 
                resembles All Might's haircut, and a respirator with a makeshift smile on it that 
                also reflects that of said hero. The costume was severely damaged as a result of his 
                first battle against Katsuki Bakugo and had to be repaired, so during the U.S.J. Arc
                 and My Hero Academia - Save! Rescue Training, Izuku had to wear the U.A. gym uniform. This attire consists of a dark blue high-collared tracksuit with thick white lines over his torso and down his legs, forming the letters "U" and "A," and along with this, a respirator.
                 <br>
                During Class 1-A's week of Ultimate Move Training, Izuku had his costume
                 upgraded again to suit his new fighting style, Shoot Style, by adding iron 
                 soles to his red boots to increase the power of his kicks. Arm braces were added,
                  and his knee pads now have yellow bolts fastened into them (they were originally 
                  added in his second costume in the manga). He called this collection of upgrades 
                  "Costume Gamma". <br>           
                Izuku's fourth hero costume, known as "Costume Delta," makes some minor alterations 
                from his previous hero costume. Before the U.A. School Festival, Mei Hatsume creates
                 support gloves to better help him use his powers for long-range attacks. Prior to 
                 the Joint Training Arc, Izuku adds the gloves to his hero costume and uses them in 
                 combat. <br>             
                After finally recovering and returning back to U.A., Izuku temporarily wore his U.A.
                 gym uniform, before his Costume Epsilon was eventually rebuilt, accompanied by a new
                  pair of Air Force Gloves attached to make-shift Mid-Gauntlets created by Mei,
                   alongside Gran Torino's cape formed as a scarf. The costume has a darker green
                    color, gold outlines instead of black, blue kneepads, and foregoes the cowl 
                    altogether, whilst retaining the damaged respirator from Costume Epsilon. 
                    This serves as Izuku's sixth hero costume, known as "Costume Zeta."</p>
             
                <h2>Powers and abilities</h2>  
                <img src="/img/side.png" alt="">
                <p>Izuku's quirk, One For All, can stockpile one's power, increasing the user's  
                    physical capabilities and being transferred from one person to another. Since
                     this quirk can be passed down from user to user, the different quirks of the 
                     previous One For All holders also become embedded into One For All as well. 
                     These powers are:</p> 
                <li><span1>Gearshift</span1>, the quirk formerly held by the second user. This allows the user to  
                    shift the speed of himself, and anything he touches.</li>      
                <li><span1>Gearshift</span1>, the quirk formerly held by the second user. This allows the user to 
                    shift the speed of himself, and anything he touches.</li>      
                <li><span1>Danger Sense</span1>, the quirk formerly held by Hikage Shinomori, the fourth user. 
                    This enables the user to detect nearby threats.</li>      
                <li><span1>Blackwhip</span1>, the quirk formerly held by Daigoro Banjo, the fifth user.
                     This enables the user to use streams of black energy in order to 
                     grab objects and capture enemies</li>      
                <li><span1>Smokescreen</span1>, the quirk formerly held by En, the sixth user.
                     This enables the user to create thick clouds of smoke, hindering vision</li>      
                <li><span1>Float </span1> , the quirk formerly held by Nana Shimura, the seventh user. 
                    This enables the user to levitate</li>
