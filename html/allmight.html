                <b>Toshinori Yagi</b> , more commonly known as <b>All Might </b>, is the overarching protagonist of the My Hero Academia franchise, serving as one of the two Deuteragonists of the main series, as well as the overarching protagonist of its spin-off My Hero Academia: Vigilantes.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Appearance </h2>
            <p>In his hero form, Toshinori is extremely tall and very muscular man, whose design resembles a generic American comic book superhero. His hair spikes on top of his head and his whole body has more shadows than any other character in the series regardless of the time of day, furthering his stylized appearance. His Hero Costume consists of a red, white, and blue bodysuit with golden gloves and boots, a lot like generic American superheroes. It has been shown with and without a cape. Overall, its design is considered very classic.
                <br><br>
                In his true form, he is an overly-skinny man with angular features, long limbs, and neck. He has spiky, dishevelled hair with two bangs framing the sides of his face and loses his eyebrows from his hero form. He possesses a large scar that covers most of the left side of his chest, and it is not uncommon for him to spout blood from his mouth when excited or surprised. He typically wears baggy clothing to accommodate his Quirk's size change, but after his true form was exposed to the world, he started wearing more fitting clothes.
                <br><br>
                Note that in both forms, his eyes are sunken in. The difference is that you can see his eyes more in his true form</p>
             
                <h2>Powers and abilities</h2>  
                <img src="/img/might.png" alt="">
                <p><span1>One For All</span1> : All Might inherited the Quirk called "One For All." It would allow him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level. </p> 
                
                <li><span1>Vestige Manifestation</span1> : All Might wielded One For All for forty years, and despite being originally Quirkless, he imbued the Quirk with his vestige. The vestige takes a crude shape of All Might, and dwells with the vestiges of past One For All users, within Izuku Midoriya. All of All Might's knowledge is transmitted to the vestiges of One For All, through his vestige. However, the vestige cannot commune with All Might unless he is in close proximity with Izuku Midoriya.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>Intimidation </span1>: Even without his powers, All Might can project his own will to intimidate others in a similar manner to Stain. However, All Might's will instead stems from his protectiveness towards Izuku and his willingness to risk his own life for his student.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>California Smash </span1>(カリフォルニア スマッシュ Kariforunia Sumasshu?): All Might attacks with a frontal somersault to built up momentum and air pressure and is then released in a smash,this attack is in name of the Dave's birthplace

                </li>      
                <li><span1>Carolina Smash</span1> (カロライナスマッシュ Karoraina Sumasshu?): All Might runs towards an enemy while keeping his hands in a cross position, then in a downwards cross chop to the enemy's head. This move is first used against Tomura, but it is intercepted by a Nomu, who withstood the full force of the attack, seemingly unharmed.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>Detroit Smash</span1> (デトロイトスマッシュ Detoroito Sumasshu?): All Might performs that same attack as Texas Smash except this move is with a downward punch instead of a straight punch. The punch is powerful enough to create a shock wave large and powerful enough to clear the weather. This move is first used to save Izuku and Katsuki from the Sludge Villain.

                </li>      
                <li><span1>United States of Smash</span1> (ユナイテッド ステイツ オブ スマッシュ Yunaiteddo Suteitesu Obu Sumasshu?): All Might throws an immensely powerful punch and smashes his target into the ground. As All Might's final and strongest move, the impact of this smash is so great that it can not only reverberate shock-waves and leave massive craters in the ground, but also spawn twisters powerful enough to carry nearby buildings. This move was used to defeat All For One and marked the end of All Might's hero career.</li>

                    <h3>MY HERO ACADEMIA</h3><br>
                    <p>The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the 
                        human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called "Quirks" 
                        (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated 
                        that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk.</p>
